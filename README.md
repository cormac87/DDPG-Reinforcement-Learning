# DDPG-Reinforcement-Learning
Created a custom DDPG reinforcement learning algorithm to teach AI how to walk and solve other control problems

I learned about reinforcement learning through watching David Silver's UCL lectures on YouTube as well as from reading Sutton and Barto's Book on Reinforcement Learning.

Also I learned how exactly to implement the DDPG and PPO algorithms from reading their technical papers

My custom training algorithm also solved Pendulum, Mountain Car and Cartpole

Also created a custom PPO reinforcement learning algorithm which worked well but I found that DDPG worked better to teach the bipedal walker to run faster
